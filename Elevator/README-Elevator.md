# Elevator
This project designed a **Multi-elevator Scheduling and Operating System**.

To achieve different functions, the system can be divided into three phases.

### Simple Elevator

The first phase is a Simple Elevator. The detailed descriptions are shown below:

- The elevator has 10 floors. Each floor has ten requested buttons inside the elevator car, and two direction buttons outside the car;
- Set the elevator to one floor when the program starts or resets;
- The Simple Elevator conducts Fool Operating Strategy, which means it  continuously scans the queue, and fetches the requests according to FAFS  (First Arrived First Servedï¼ŒFAFS) policy. Only when the request is executed, the next request will be scheduled.
- The elevator spends 0.5s to run one floor. After reaching the floor, the series of actions such as stopping and opening the door comsumes 1s.

Input Specifications:

- Floor request: `(FR, m, UP/DOWN, T)`. `FR` is a fixed signal, `m` is the requested floor number, `UP` and `DOWN` are direction requests, and `T` is the  time when the request appears.
- Inside car request: `(ER, n, T)` .`ER` is a fixed signal, `n` is the requested floor number, and `T` is the  time when the request appears.

Output Specifications:

- `(n, UP/DOWN, t)` . `n` is floor number, `UP` and `DOWN` are direction that elevator heads for, and `t` is the operation time from the first request appears.

Class Contains:

- Control.java
- Elevator.java
- Floor.java
- Main.java
- Request.java
- RequestQueue.java

### Smart Elevator

The Smart Elevator is designed on the basis of Simple Elevator, which introducing `extends` mechanism to implement more functions.

Compared to the Simple Elevator, the Smart Elevator adds some basic descriptions:

- The elevator system consists of three identical elevators.
-  Three elevators run between 1 (include) and 20 (include) floors.
- The system is arranged by a scheduler, which determines how the three elevators respond to the floor request (FR request). The ER request can only be processed by the elevator.
- In order to improve the observability of the system state during the test, it is necessary to set the elevator to run on one floor for 3s and the opening&closing door process consumes 6s.
- The Smart Elevator can respond requests passingly.

### Multi-elevator Scheduling and Operating System

The Multi-elevator System contains three elevators by implementing the Multithreading mechanism.

Class Contains:

- Control.java
- Elevator.java
- Floor.java
- Main.java
- Request.java
- RequestList.java
- RequestMonitor
